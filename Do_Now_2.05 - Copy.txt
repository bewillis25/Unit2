 >>> a.remove('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
Continue in your notebook

What does remove do? It removes a designated item from a list.

What would the length of this list be after remove? 2

What happens to a? Its printed out as a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item'] but the list stays the same

What is b? [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item', 'Third Item']
